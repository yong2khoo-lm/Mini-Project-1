# To-do: Write descriptions

Description:
1. LinkedIn as one of the most popular platform for candidate searching
2. Market demand on Data Scientist expertise is increasing, demand is greater than supply
3. Thus, potential candidate overview and speed in identify the correct candidate is crucial in this talent war
4. With this, we have the idea to scrap the LinkedIn profile, focus on Data Scientist

Approach:
1. Web scraping on LinkedIn, focus only on Data Scientist
2. Scraping frequency/Sample collection approach
    - Hourly with 10 rows of data, started 15th Aug 2022, ended xxx
3. xxx rows of data extracted

Analysis and Visualization:
1. Data Scientist @Location - To understand the candidate origin location and thus define hiring strategy. Pie chart gives good overview on the most dense Data Scientist location
2. Data Scientist @Education Level - To get insight of Data Scientist education level, as candidate filter to the hiring job scope - Pie chart is applied for clear overview
3. Data Scientist Working Years Distribution - Access the market Data Scientist years of experience. Histogram could give good insight on experience distribution
4. Data Scientist skillset - What is the most crucial skillset as Data Scientist? Pareto could give us very good importance view, from the most popular to least popular skillset

Challenge:
1. LinkedIn doesn't allow big scale of scrapping. It will be detected as unusual activity and warning is gived
2. For overcome the limitation
    - Smaller scale of scraping with acceptable frequency (houly in this case) is established
    - Alternative account is created to continue the scraping activity
